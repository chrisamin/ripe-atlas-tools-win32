# ripe-atlas-tools-win32
This is an *EXPERIMENTAL* Windows installer for the [RIPE Atlas Tools](https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/ripe-atlas-tools).

The tools in this repository simply use [pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) and [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) to package ripe-atlas-tools as a standalone distribution that requires no existing Python installation. If you are running Windows and have a working Python environment, you may be able to just install ripe-atlas-tools yourself. The pyinstaller parts could theoretically be used for packaging standalone 

You can try the released installer here:

Keep in mind that this is currently a preview release and there will probably be bugs! Please let me know if you find them.
